EXECUTION
Creation of global execution context ( for top- level code)
1) - the code is not inside any function 
such like page loaded 
const name = 'Cezar'
then function declaration wil be declared and call later
 then this // code Human readable 
  const first = () => { 
  //  
 let a = 1;
const b = second();
a = a + b;
return a;
};

and this //
function second (){
    //
    var c = 2; return c;
}
// but the body of function only will be executed when called!!!
